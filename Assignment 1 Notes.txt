1. Links to both your own pages and external webpages:
Home page - flag images holds links to wikitravel pages for countries.
Navigation bar links to other pages on website.

2. A navigation bar:
Included.
 
3. At least one table:
In Budgeting page.

4. At least one list (ordered or unordered):
List used in navigation bar and itinenary page for text.

5. At least one local or embedded video:
Video below image gallery on last page.
 
6. At least four CSS3 and four HTML5 elements:
I used lists, headings, paragraphs and images for HTML. I also used margin, border, text align and display for CSS.

7. Make use of the CSS positional properties (e.g. position, float):
Hightlight page - Images floated to right of text with overflow used to keep consistency.
Navigation bar positioned absolute. 
Main heading - "Asia and back again" positioned relative to allow me to center it to middle of page.

8. Make use of both inline and block elements:
Display -  Inline block used to make navigation bar horizontal.
Homepage - Inline block used to orient images so they don't interrupt text margins/paddings.
Image in itinenary page changed to block element using display property to keep centred.

9: Explored additional features of HTML and CSS:
Homepage - Used wrapper id and inline block to make 3 even columns. 
Highlights - overflow used to ensure images don't spill out of the div boxes they are contained in.
Homepage - @media used to make page more responsive when minimized.
Gallery - overflow used again to keep images and video separate. Opacity hover added to when cursor over an image, and
description under each image added.
Logo inserted in header bar.
