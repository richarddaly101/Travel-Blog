<h2>Visa</h2>
<p class="text">With the exception of Vietnam, I found the VISA process for Taiwan and Japan very straightforward. You simply had to fill in an arrival form after flying in to then being granted a visa at airport immigration. Vietnam was a bit more complicated; as a European citizen I needed to apply for a visa online before I travelled over, wait a couple of days for it to process and then present it at immigration.</p>

<h2>Accomodation</h2>
<p class="text">Accomodation cost will vary greatly depending on the country and type of accomodation sought. On average however prices in Vietnam will be much lower than Taiwan or Japan for both hotels and hostels, with Japan's cost in particular being comparable to Ireland. It's worth noting that some hostels in Asia are high quality and can be comparable to lower end hotels.</p>

<h2>Food</h2>
<p class="text">The prices below assume you will be eating out the vast majority of the time, each country hosts a range of unique culinary delights that should not be missed. Something to bear in mind is that price doesn't necessarily indicate quality. For example, some of the cheapest food is also the tastiest, while generic fast food such as McDonald's can be overly expensive.</p>
