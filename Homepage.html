<h1 class="main-heading">About this website</h1>
   <p class="intro">This website gives an account of my trip across South East and Eastern Asia, which I undertook in early 2019. I want to share my experience of this trip, along with providing some advice for anyone considering making the same kind of journey. I hope you enjoy it!</p>

   <p class="country">Vietnam is the easternmost country of South East Asia. It's capital city is Hanoi with its most populated city being Ho Chi Minh City. Despite a difficult past, Vietnam has emerged as one of the most popular destinations in South East Asia, and for good reason. It is host to spectacular and varied scenery, some amazing food and can be very gentle on the wallet which is an enticing combination for any visitor.

   <p class="country">Taiwan is an island off the coast of Japan and just north of the Phillipines. Perhaps overshadowed by some of its higher profile neighbours, Taiwan has plenty to offer to ensure a memorable stay. Center of this are the people, who will go out of their way to welcome you and make you feel at home. The food is excellent, but be warned for high levels of spice! Along with this there is a vibrant nightlife in Taepei, from ultra trendy clubs to craft beer pubs.

    <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Japan" target="_blank"> <img class="countryimage" src="Images/Japan%20Flag.png" alt="Japan Flag"></a>
   <p class="country">It goes without saying that Japan is one of the most popular destinations in the world and it has earned this merit. Featuring an intoxicating mix of the old and new, Japan has something to offer everyone, from the young backpacker seeking hedonism to the retired couple wanting a relaxed experience. For my trip I really think I saved the best for last, even with stiff competition Japan remains my favourite that country I have visited. It has it all: delicious food, great people, and amazing sights and sounds. Just don't expect it to be easy on your wallet!
