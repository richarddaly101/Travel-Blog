<h1 class=main-heading>My top three experiences</h1>
    
 <p class="intro">It's difficult to shortlist a highlight list from this trip as there were so many unforgettable moments. Regardless I've done my best to round it down to a place or event from each country that encapsulates what I feel they have to offer for any visitor.</p>

    <h2>Sapa</h2>
    <br>
       <p>Sapa is a mountainous area in Northern Vietnam that is close to the border with China. I found this a beautiful area, it's rice fields nestled in the hills gives a surreal look that makes it appear if it has come straight out of a painting. I visited this area as part of a tour which included a homestay at a local Vietnamese family's house. We did trekking during the day which was surprisingly tough! This was a unique experience and remains one of the highlights of my trip.</p>

    <h2>Kyoto</h2>
    <br>
       <p>Kyoto is the ancient capital of Japan and considered it's cultural capital. This is probably my favourite city I visited during the entire trip; it's peaceful atmosphere was a welcome reprieve from the madness of Toyko where I had travelled from. The main draw for Kyoto are it's temples where there are an astonishing 1600 to be found. My favourite was one called the Kiyomizu-dera, it's location on a mountaintop gave me a marvelleous view of the city.</p>

    <h2>Shilin Night Market</h2>
    <br>
       <p>Shilin Night Market is located in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan. It is one of the most famous food market in the country and for good reason. I visited there one evening and ate enough to fill me for the rest of the week. Some of the amazing dishes on offer were battered octopus with potato scratchings, fried ice cream and the bizarre stinky tofu. Along with this there were a bewildering array of stalls selling things from handbags to jewellery, and a couple of pop up bars offering liquid refreshment after a hearty meal.</p>
